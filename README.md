# Music Modifier
Simple script for modifying and viewing music files.  

Currently only works with mp3 files.

## To-Do:
- Rename files based on song title. Do this by retrieving the song title and changing the name, possibly in numbers_remover.
- Before running getArtistData, run a check to ensure all files have the relevant information.  
- Get .m4a files to work in playlist_data.
- Attach original path to track objects.
- Add ability to enter multiple URLs for various YouTube videos, download the files as MP3s, and also include all the tag information automatically (maybe make as separate application?).
- Add ability to automatically fill in tag information by scraping from internet, maybe a particular website?

## Miscellaneous
- Naming conventions should be followed as defined here:
