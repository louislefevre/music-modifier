# Music Modifier
Simple script for modifying and viewing music files.  

Currently only works with mp3 files.

## To-Do:
- Rename files based on song title. Do this by retrieving the song title and changing the name, possibly in numbers_remover.
- Before running getArtistData, run a check to ensure all files have the relevant information.  
- Get .m4a files to work in playlist_data.
- Attach original path to track objects.
- Add feature to scrape internet for album art, save image and place it in album folder.
- Add feature to convert all 'Singles' to 'EP'

## Miscellaneous
- Naming conventions should be followed as defined here:
