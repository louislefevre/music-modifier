# Music Modifier
Simple script for modifying and viewing music files.  

## To-Do:
- Retrieve the title of the song and use that instead?  
- Before running getArtistData, run a check to ensure all files have the relevant information.  
- Add functionality to automatically organise new music. For example, give it a song with the band the album, position, etc, and it will automatically move it to the correct location. If the location doesn't exist, it will create it.  

## Miscellaneous
- Naming conventions should be followed as defined here:
