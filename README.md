# Music Modifier
Simple script for modifying and viewing music files.  

## To-Do:
- Retrieve the title of the song and use that instead?  
- Create functionality to export music data to text file (organised by bands, albums, etc)  
- Before running getArtistData, run a check to ensure all files have the relevant information.  
- Add functionality to automatically organise new music. For example, give it a song with the band the album, position, etc, and it will automatically move it to the correct location. If the location doesn't exist, it will create it.  
- Combinate file search functions to a single function, with different methods being passed or something.
