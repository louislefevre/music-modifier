# Music Modifier
Simple script for modifying and viewing music files.  

Currently only works with mp3 files.

## To-Do:
- Rename files based on song title.
- Run a check to ensure all files have the relevant information before gathering.
- Get .m4a files to work.
- Add feature to scrape internet for album art, save image and place it in album folder.
- Add feature to convert all 'Singles' to 'EP'.
- Add feature to fill in any missing information with default values.
- Add ability to enter multiple URLs for various YouTube videos, download the files as MP3s, and also include all the tag information automatically (maybe make as separate application?).
- Add ability to automatically fill in tag information by scraping from internet, maybe a particular website?

## Miscellaneous
- Naming conventions should be followed as defined here:
